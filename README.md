# conways-game-of-life
My implementation of Conway's Game of Life, written in C using the Raylib library.

Compiles using C23.

To compile and run the game, do as follows:

Install Raylib on your system. Then:

```console
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake --build .
```

You can use space to pause and unpause the game, and left mouse click to activate a cell.

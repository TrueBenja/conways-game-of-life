# conways-game-of-life
My implementation of Conway's Game of Life, written in C using the Raylib library.
You can use space to pause and unpause the game, and left mouse click to activate a cell.

Compiles using C23.

To compile and run the game, do as follows:

```console
mkdir build && \
cd build && \
cmake .. && \
cmake --build .
```
